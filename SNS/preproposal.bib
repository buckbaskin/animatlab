abstract = {Current robotic control methods take advantage of high computing power to compute trajectories and perform optimal movements for a given task, yet these robots still fall far short of their animal counterparts when interacting with the environment. Animals dynamically adapt to varying terrain and small perturbations almost effort- lessly. In order to improve our robotic systems and build better control methods, it makes sense to look more closely at how animals solve this interaction. In this work, I developed a control model of mammalian walking with models grounded in neuroscience and computational neuroscience. First, I developed a neuromechanical model of a rat with 14 degrees of freedom and 28 muscles, and I explored how hypoth- esized neural architectures can be used to coordinate four limbs in a walking gait for a rat. Additionally, through simulated ablation experiments, I developed hypothe- ses on how inter-leg pathways work together to maintain limb timing. After this, I developed a procedure to train the neural system to produce dynamic walking in both a rat simulation and a robot named Puppy. This method works by first using a model of the system (rat or robot) to determine required motor neuron activations to produce stable walking. For the robot, this required building a force-length-pressure model of the McKibben actuators to enable accurate force control. Parameters in the neural system are then set such that it produces similar activations to the desired pattern. I applied the same training procedure to both the simulated rat and the robot and show that it is capable of producing continuous, self-supported stepping in both systems.},

abstract = {A dynamical model of an animal's nervous system, or synthetic nervous system (SNS), is a potentially transformational control method. Due to increasingly detailed data on the connectivity and dynamics of both mammalian and insect nervous systems, controlling a legged robot with an SNS is largely a problem of parameter tuning. Our approach to this problem is to design functional subnetworks that perform specific operations, and then assemble them into larger models of the nervous system. In this paper, we present networks that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration of incoming signals. Parameters are set within each subnetwork to produce the desired output by utilizing the operating range of neural activity, R, the gain of the operation, k, and bounds based on biological values. The assembly of large networks from functional subnetworks underpins our recent results with MantisBot.},

@article{Hunt2017,
abstract = {Animals dynamically adapt to varying terrain and small perturbations with remarkable ease. These adaptations arise from complex interactions between the environment and biomechanical and neural components of the animal's body and nervous system. Research into mammalian locomotion has resulted in several neural and neuro-mechanical models, some of which have been tested in simulation, but few "synthetic nervous systems" have been implemented in physical hardware models of animal systems. One reason is that the implementation into a physical system is not straightforward. For example, it is difficult to make robotic actuators and sensors that model those in the animal. Therefore, even if the sensorimotor circuits were known in great detail, those parameters would not be applicable and new parameter values must be found for the network in the robotic model of the animal. This manuscript demonstrates an automatic method for setting parameter values in a synthetic nervous system composed of non-spiking leaky integrator neuron models. This method works by first using a model of the system to determine required motor neuron activations to produce stable walking. Parameters in the neural system are then tuned systematically such that it produces similar activations to the desired pattern determined using expected sensory feedback. We demonstrate that the developed method successfully produces adaptive locomotion in the rear legs of a dog-like robot actuated by artificial muscles. Furthermore, the results support the validity of current models of mammalian locomotion. This research will serve as a basis for testing more complex locomotion controllers and for testing specific sensory pathways and biomechanical designs. Additionally, the developed method can be used to automatically adapt the neural controller for different mechanical designs such that it could be used to control different robotic systems.},

@article{Varilly2008,
abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) located in the spinal cord produce the coordinated activation of flexor and extensor motoneurons during locomotion. Previously proposed architectures for the spinal locomotor CPG have included the classical half-center oscillator and the unit burst generator (UBG) comprised of multiple coupled oscillators. We have recently proposed another organization in which a two-level CPG has a common rhythm generator (RG) that controls the operation of the pattern formation (PF) circuitry responsible for motoneuron activation. These architectures are discussed in relation to recent data obtained during fictive locomotion in the decerebrate cat. The data show that the CPG can maintain the period and phase of locomotor oscillations both during spontaneous deletions of motoneuron activity and during sensory stimulation affecting motoneuron activity throughout the limb. The proposed two-level CPG organization has been investigated with a computational model which incorporates interactions between the CPG, spinal circuits and afferent inputs. The model includes interacting populations of spinal interneurons and motoneurons modeled in the Hodgkin-Huxley style. Our simulations demonstrate that a relatively simple CPG with separate RG and PF networks can realistically reproduce many experimental phenomena including spontaneous deletions of motoneuron activity and a variety of effects of afferent stimulation. The model suggests plausible explanations for a number of features of real CPG operation that would be difficult to explain in the framework of the classical single-level CPG organization. Some modeling predictions and directions for further studies of locomotor CPG organization are discussed.},
annote = {Multi-Level CPG Organization

This is starting to feel like feedforward control with the feedforward being the pattern at a certain rpm where sensors/observers for each joint provide PID control of some sort and update the state/phase. There's a tight control loop based on the current desired position (PID), a looser control loop based on the phase of up-close CPG and then a "loose" one for incorporating sensor feedback. 

Reflexes may operate outside of it, i.e. when motion towards a tripping scenario is found, activate a reflex to step quickly out.},

@article{Smith2015,
abstract = {Biomimetic leg designs often appear to be arbitrarily chosen. To make a more objective choice regarding biomimetic leg configuration for small canine-inspired robots, we compare one hind leg to the same leg arranged in a different orientation, and show that the less biomimetic leg provides better performance. This differently-oriented leg design, which we call "transverse-mirrored" was more efficient and faster, both in simulation and experiment even though both leg configurations used the same passive and active components, rest angles, and monoarticular knee spring. In experiments the normal configuration had a maximum speed of 0.33 m{\textperiodcentered}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and a specific resistance of 5.1. Conversely, the less biomimetic transverse-mirrored configuration had a maximum speed of 0.4 m{\textperiodcentered}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and specific resistance of 3.9. Therefore the transverse-mirrored leg's best performance yields a 21{\%} increase in speed and 24{\%} decrease in specific resistance when compared to the best performance achieved in the normal biomimetic leg. The major underlying reason is that the knee spring engages more readily in the transverse-mirrored configuration, resulting in this faster and more efficient locomotion. The conclusion is that simply copying from nature does not lead to optimal performance and that insight into the role played by passive design components on natural locomotory dynamics is important.},

@article{Zhong2012,
abstract = {We explored the organization of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion by analysing the activity of spinal interneurons and motoneurons during spontaneous deletions occurring during fictive locomotion in the isolated neonatal mouse spinal cord, following earlier work on locomotor deletions in the cat. In the isolated mouse spinal cord, most spontaneous deletions were non-resetting, with rhythmic activity resuming after an integer number of cycles. Flexor and extensor deletions showed marked asymmetry: flexor deletions were accompanied by sustained ipsilateral extensor activity, whereas rhythmic flexor bursting was not perturbed during extensor deletions. Rhythmic activity on one side of the cord was not perturbed during non-resetting spontaneous deletions on the other side, and these deletions could occur with no input from the other side of the cord. These results suggest that the locomotor CPG has a two-level organization with rhythm-generating (RG) and pattern-forming (PF) networks, in which only the flexor RG network is intrinsically rhythmic. To further explore the neuronal organization of the CPG, we monitored activity of motoneurons and selected identified interneurons during spontaneous non-resetting deletions. Motoneurons lost rhythmic synaptic drive during ipsilateral deletions. Flexor-related commissural interneurons continued to fire rhythmically during non-resetting ipsilateral flexor deletions. Deletion analysis revealed two classes of rhythmic V2a interneurons. Type I V2a interneurons retained rhythmic synaptic drive and firing during ipsilateral motor deletions, while type IIV2a interneurons lost rhythmic synaptic input and fell silent during deletions. This suggests that the type I neurons are components of the RG, whereas the type II neurons are components of the PF network.We propose a computational model of the spinal locomotor CPG that reproduces our experimental results. The results may provide novel insights into the organization of spinal locomotor networks.},
