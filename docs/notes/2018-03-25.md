## Discussion

The initial velocity estimation matters a lot. If it is inaccurate, the forward projection breaks. In general I think the system would be more stable and possibly overdamped if the velocity estimation were slightly underestimated.
If the estimate is low, an insufficient correction would be made and the joint swings to a joint limit.
If the magnitude of the estimate is too high compared to reality, then the controller will only make maximum adjustments and the system won't stabilize.

A better velocity model could be done by using the internal model to project forward and optimize to the measured position, then pick torque, acceleration and velocity from that.

Question: How does this converge if it starts off kinda far from the actual state?
