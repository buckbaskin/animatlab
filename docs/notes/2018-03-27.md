Attempting to get an optimizing controller working. Right now it is only estimating damping, with a minimum and an inconsequential maximum.

Actual values are:
```
ActualSimulator(M=0.0039, C=0.1000, N=-1.7167)
```
A value of 0.1 for C is stable and tracks nicely.

In the end I think that the proper way to do the parameter estimation will be to implement an Extended Kalman Filter.

It appears that the local improvement assumption is bad. It might get fixed by estimating
