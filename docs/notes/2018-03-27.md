## Discussion

Attempting to get an optimizing controller working. Right now it is only estimating damping, with a minimum and an inconsequential maximum.

Actual values are:
```
ActualSimulator(M=0.0039, C=0.1000, N=-1.7167)
```
A value of 0.1 for C is stable and tracks nicely.

In the end I think that the proper way to do the parameter estimation will be to implement an Extended Kalman Filter.

It appears that the local improvement assumption is bad. It might get fixed by estimating

### More Thoughts

It may also be that the updates are wrong in some way, or they should at least be low passed to avoid dynamic instability where quick changes destabilize system in a time of need.

If you see SSM_Interesting2, you'll see that a quick change in the estimate of the damping factor causes some instability.

## Technically 3/28

Phase isn't interesting with this controller. It's pretty perfect (within 0.01 deg)
until it fails to track, and then it's not well defined because its not a sin
wave.
