## Talking w/ Nick 3/5

### Next Steps
[.] Linear stability analysis of PD angle/torque control for large angles
[ ] Level curve for stiffness -> pick stiffness -> select angle from there
[ ] Build a dynamic model, 2 different Festos, negative feedback based on pressure/position curves
[ ] Incorporate a discrete pressure update, update frequency of the controllers. Limits stability at high stiffness
[ ] Then do lagging mass models that show how low stiffness can get
[ ] Control input, desired position, sin wave of frequency, Bode plot, analyze
[ ] Numerically analyze nonlinear system, doing the same stuff as for a linear system

### Future Thoughts
[ ] Update stiffness in a 3 joint model in simulation adding or removing weights
