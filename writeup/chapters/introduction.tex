Animals adapt to their environment through physical structure and compliance as
well as adapting through a learning process in the nervous system. While the
simulation or replication of both the physical and neural systems in their
entirety is a very complex task, lessons can be taken from the neural control of
muscles to better control a walking robot.

\section{Task Overview}

Walking a quadruped

\section{Why Walking?}

This particular thesis focuses on control of joints for the canine-inspired
Puppy robot. The two distinguishing physical features of the robot are its
pneumatic muscle actuators and a design that leans heavily on the mechanics and
skeleton of canines.
